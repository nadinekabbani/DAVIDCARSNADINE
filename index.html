        We are aware that at the 19th century, the text is in the shock of massive new technologies and electrotyping. The second half of the 20th century is dedicated to the digital era, in favor of pixels flickering on a screen rather than ink and paper. Handwritten
        efforts seem to disappear as the text enters a new era known as over the top typographical standard. Typography was taken into another level of experimentations in the 1990s, and David Carson was at its center.<sup>1</sup> His work is
        of a definite style, it is unique, exciting colorful and vibrant. It has it’s place in the history of design and defines an era. In fact, nothing influenced him to embark on typography at an early age. Born on September 8, 1954, Carson is an American
        graphic design, art director and surfer. He is known for his innovative magazine design, and use of experimental typography creating chaos. He was the art director for the magazine Ray Gun, in which he experimented with typographic and layout
        styles for which is he became famous for. His unique experiments with typography has brought him fame. It was David’s widely copied aesthetic that carved the “grunge typography” era<sup>2</sup> .Throughout this research, we’re going to have a
        look at Carson’s early life and career path as well as the influence he has on graphic designers today.

      </p>

      <p class=" f5 f5-ns lh-copy  georgia">
        Born in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1954 Carson attended Cocoa Beach High school where he was school president for 3 years. Later, he received a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the San Diego State University. In 1980, Carson was a 26-year-old high school
        teacher in southern Oregon. He received a flyer in the mail for a summer program in graphic design at the University of Arizona in Tucson and decided to attend. The two-week graphic design workshop was taught by Jackson Boelts, who became a mentor
        and really good friend. There he discovered typography and layout and came to realize his natural talent in graphic design. A few years later, in 1983, Carson started to experiment with graphic design and found himself interested in the artistic
        and bohemian culture of Southern California. He attended the Oregon College of Commercial Art, only for a couple months before accepting an unpaid internship with Action Now magazine, formerly Skateboarder magazine. Carson joined the magazine
        Transworld Skateboarding as its art director in 1984 and helped it achieve a unique look thanks to his signature style that relied mostly on unconventional photography techniques and “dirty type”<sup>3</sup> . In addition to this, in 1987,
        he also became the art director of a spinoff magazine Transworld Snowboarding. In parallel, his next important influence was Hans-Rudolf Lutz, a Swiss teacher who taught a three-weeks workshop in Switzerland and who challenged Carson to work experimentally
        and to find reasons for shaping form in particular ways.

        Carson then started designing the “Beach Culture” for the Surfer magazine. Surrounded by a team of graphic designers, he experimented wildly, breaking all the rules of typography and layout. Though only six quarterly issues were produced, the tabloid-size
        publication allowed Carson to make his first significant impact on the world of graphic design and typography with ideas that were called innovative even by those that were not found of his work, in which legibility often relied on reader’s strict
        attention. Unfortunately, the chaotic presentation of the magazine scared off advertising, so the magazine stopped publishing in 1991. Soon after, in 1992, Carson won the artistic direction of Ray Gun. Together with Marvin Scott he started designing
        for this innovative lifestyle and rock and roll music magazine publishing just over 70 issues. An example of his type decision is his use of Dingbat font that is known for having illegible symbols for an interview with Bryan Ferry, a singer, because
        he considered it to be a boring interview. It was at Ray Gun that he became an important name in the business till 1995, date in which he returns to advertising and working for his own firm in New York City.

        A number of his work and designs are presented in The end of print <sup>4</sup> and David Carson: 2ndsight,<sup>5</sup> two of his publications in collaboration with graphic designer Lewis Blackwell and where Carson has a strong input on the layout.
        A simple glimpse through couple of spreads in these publications gives us a big idea of the way Carson manipulates typography in his own work.

      <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy  georgia">
        In the cover page of The end of print, the composition of words and images is already revealing the layout break or explosion that are different from any standard layout we are used to. Through different pages, we discover that nothing has been designed
        for an ideal legible typography composition: the half title is almost entirely hidden by a collage, the publication date is nowhere to be found; on top of that, the book contains no running head and no page numbers. Throughout the book, the spreads
        layout is not regular: some pages have a very large upper margin while most leave no space between the edge and the text. Also, sometime the lines are overlapping creating a very hard way of reading the content. Is he trying to create composition
        so people look at text and not read it? His work involves playing with collages, leaving spots, or printing on black background and many other experimental ways of playing with the layout but also spreading text blocks in an irregular or random
        way, breaking lines or words throughout the page. His work becomes a real experimental piece. In short, one can hardly imagine text treated and distorted to more tortures and to its limit of legibility.

      <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy  georgia">
        In his work, the illustrations are not treated with so much respect, Carson treats the images with full control by distorting them creating visual ¨punches that almost blurs their content. Far from looking to be precise within the frame, the result gives
        a complete new perspective, confused images, reworked with force airbrush on Photoshop. What happens as well, a large empty frame placed right in the middle of an article with a large typographic message “(((sorry))) no graphics” to ironically
        emphasize the lack of illustration.

        The first impression one has looking at some spreads designs is the choice of colorful pictures and unpredictable symbols rather than text. Reading, in fact, does not start spontaneously, so much that our reflex of reading is shifted by a text that differs
        radically from any standard format. In most cases, it is difficult even to determine where the text begins, how lines are flowing, and whether sudden changes in font are not randomly done by a child who played with letters, rather than the manifestation
        of an intention to communicate. To avoid any consistency, each page has its unique gestures of graphic surprises. There is however, a system or reason behind every layout choice. Carson says that he reads each article in order to give an adequate
        visual interpretation “I read the copy and then I try to interpret it”<sup>6</sup>; the articles that he least inspire him are designed in a classic layout, which can be perceived back by their authors as a sort of denial by Carson to
        work with their content.<sup>7</sup> Another example, in Beach culture, an article on teaching surfing to the blind opens with a spread that is entirely black; the confusion for the reader and the loss of visual indexes undoubtedly constitutes
        a relevant introduction to the subject of visual reaction and legibility. Another exercise that Carson explores in workshops that he organizes is to design a layout that is totally unrelated for the content of the given article, such as presenting
        an article on homeless people in the manner of a fashion magazine article. Carson is aware of the problems of legibility that this aesthetic poses. However, he does not take a step backwards in the notion of legibility , he defends his interest
        and ambition to this notion in relation to an economical communication. More specifically, he criticizes that legibility ignores emotions. Even though he understands their importance, it does not matter to him to be legible if no emotion is communicated.
        It is this search for this effect, an emotional reaction, that interests him in the first place “You can be legible, but what is the emotion contained in the message? That is important to me. [...] When I turn to a page in a book, to a magazine,
        to any graphic design, I want an emotional reaction.”<sup>8</sup>

        It should be noted that this rhetoric of visual shock and perception of feeling is very close to what advertising aesthetics responds to. Several major companies have not mistaken, and have been competing for 10 years for Carsons design services: Giorgio
        Armani, Microsoft, Nike, Pepsi to name a few. In a poster that he worked on in 1992 for the Camaro car, but which has not been used, the graphic designer takes the risk of playing around with only typography: line spacing, lettering, and font
        size. The result is a visual disorientation effect which, even if it does not last, is able to leave a mark in the readers memory, ideally a trace accompanied by the feeling of satisfaction of reading after a first glimpse, could look like an
        unreadable composition<sup>9</sup>. The movement in which typography becomes a spectacle is therefore not a spontaneous one. In an article about David Carson, Rick Poynor highlighted Carsons influence to the aesthetics of MTV’s style television,
        as well as on some pioneers of postmodern graphic designers, such as April Greiman and Rudy VanderLands of Émigré magazine.

        Wired magazine, whose first issue contained an article on Ray Gun and David Carson<sup>10</sup>, illustrates the success of this new era in the 90s. Even though the aggressive graphics are sometimes free and can be interpreted as illegible he
        contributed in giving to the magazine a distinctive style and made remarkable relationships between both the printed medium and the content itself. The aesthetic of this typography of spectacle now tend to spread around the world of advertising
        and magazine to expand to the world of books. This is the case, for example, with the Ray Gun: Out of Control, where the reader must look at it two or three times before finding the page key that is subtly integrated into the content, inserted
        on a colored space and graphically saturated almost feels like its half-erased. When in 1997, photographer Albert Watson asked David Carson to make a layout for Cyclops<sup>11</sup>, an album about his career as a photographer, we face a new era
        where the graphic design is able to influence his style for shaping a book, just like a fashion designer who puts his signature on a collection of clothing. The authorship is no longer reserved to the author of the text or the illustrator but
        can be dedicated to the expert typographer.

        Carsons work comes at a time when the digital and type has taking a step further compared to its practice a century ago. The windows of kiosks are invaded by thousands of magazines, with an impeccable typography and layout that is often lacking a visual
        identity. Above all, the computer has become at the time unavoidable in the production of text, reducing the use and practice of handwriting given less freedom, and less time to experiment or make mistake that influence the resulted design. Even
        private correspondence now goes on the Internet, making letters and personal message disappearing in the first age of e-mails between 1987 and 1997. We faced an emotional effect that once have reflected on the choice of paper, the color of the
        ink, the form of the writing, the shaking behind the word inscription, traces of erasing and possible tears to a black on white letter written in Arial. For graphic designers, success and controversy rarely go hand in hand. David Carson flaunted
        that rule, along with just about every design principle when he became the founding art director of Ray Gun. A latecomer to graphic design, his expressive approach to typography that was he became critically famous for, compromised legibility
        but generated emotions and expressed design work that we still look back at today with a sensitive eye.
